Feature 1: Natural Language Understanding
Problem:
AgentGPT needs to be able to understand and interpret natural language inputs from users in order to provide meaningful responses.

Solution:
Implement a Natural Language Understanding (NLU) module that can process and analyze the user's input text. This module should be able to extract important information from the user's query, such as the intent and entities.

Code:
Python
Copy Code
def nlu(input_text):
    # Implement NLU logic to extract intent and entities from input_text
    intent = "unknown"
    entities = []
  
    # Code to analyze input_text, extract intent and entities
  
    return intent, entities
Explanation:
The nlu function takes an input text as a parameter and returns the intent and entities extracted from the input text. The implementation of the NLU logic will depend on the specific requirements and constraints of AgentGPT. This could involve using techniques like rule-based parsing, keyword matching, or even machine learning-based approaches like natural language processing (NLP) or natural language understanding (NLU) models.

Feature 2: Context Management
Problem:
AgentGPT needs to be able to maintain context and remember information from previous interactions with the user. This is crucial for maintaining conversations and providing relevant responses.

Solution:
Implement a Context Management module that can store and update the conversation context. This module should be able to track important information from previous interactions, such as user preferences, context-specific data, or system state.

Code:
Python
Copy Code
class ContextManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.context = {}
    
    def update_context(self, key, value):
        # Update the context with the given key-value pair
        self.context[key] = value
    
    def get_context(self, key):
        # Retrieve the value associated with the given key from the context
        return self.context.get(key)
Explanation:
The ContextManager class provides a way to store and retrieve information from the conversation context. The context is stored as a dictionary, where the keys represent the context variables and the values represent the corresponding values. The update_context method allows updating the context with new key-value pairs, and the get_context method allows retrieving the value associated with a specific key from the context.
